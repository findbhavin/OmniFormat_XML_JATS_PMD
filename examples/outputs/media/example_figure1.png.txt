# This is a placeholder for an example image file
# In a real pipeline, this would be a PNG image extracted from the DOCX file

To create actual image files:
- The pipeline extracts images from DOCX files
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG
- Images are referenced in the HTML output
- Media files are packaged in the output ZIP

Example image generation would produce:
- example_figure1.png (chart/graph)
- example_figure2.jpg (photo)
- example_table_image.png (table as image)
